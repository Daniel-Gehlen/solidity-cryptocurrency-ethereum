# Technical Report: Development of EtherPulse Cryptocurrency

## Introduction:
This report describes the development process of a cryptocurrency called EtherPulse using the Solidity programming language and smart contracts. The goal was to create a functional cryptocurrency that complies with the ERC-20 standards and allows token transfers between Ethereum addresses.

## Project Structure:
The project was organized into a directory and file structure as follows:

```
└── EtherPulse
├── contracts
│ └── EtherPulse.sol
└── migrations
└── 1_initial_migration.js
```


- `contracts/EtherPulse.sol`: This file contains the source code of the EtherPulse smart contract, which implements the ERC-20 standard for the cryptocurrency. It defines basic functionalities of a cryptocurrency, such as token transfer, approval of spending, and balance inquiry.
- `migrations/1_initial_migration.js`: This file is a Truffle migration script responsible for deploying the EtherPulse contract to the Ethereum blockchain. It specifies deployment parameters such as the initial token supply.

## Technical Details:
- The EtherPulse smart contract implements the ERC-20 interface, which defines a set of standard methods and events for Ethereum tokens.
- The contract has private variables to store token balances of each address, authorized spending allowances, and the total tokens in circulation.
- Functions were implemented to transfer tokens between addresses, approve token spending by third parties, and allow third parties to spend tokens on behalf of owners.
- The contract also has internal functions to handle token transfers, minting (creation) of new tokens, and spending approval.

## Results and Conclusion:
The EtherPulse cryptocurrency was successfully developed according to the specified requirements. The smart contract was tested locally using the Truffle development environment and deployed successfully to the Ethereum blockchain. The project structure allows for easy maintenance and extensibility for future updates and enhancements.

In summary, the development of the EtherPulse cryptocurrency was a success, providing a functional implementation compliant with the ERC-20 standard in the Ethereum ecosystem.
